# Directory where notes are stored as markdown files
# Recommend using absolute paths for centralized storage across projects
ZETTELKASTEN_NOTES_DIR=~/.zettelkasten/notes

# SQLite database for indexing and search

# Optional: Mirror notes to an Obsidian vault
# When set, notes are organized into project-based subdirectories:
#   <vault>/general/Note Title.md
#   <vault>/my-project/Another Note.md
#
# Use zk_sync_to_obsidian tool or ./scripts/sync-to-obsidian to bulk sync
# ZETTELKASTEN_OBSIDIAN_VAULT=/path/to/obsidian/vault/zettelkasten

# Git Versioning (for multi-process concurrency)
# When true, notes are version-controlled with git for conflict detection
# Each note update gets a commit hash that can be used to detect concurrent edits
ZETTELKASTEN_GIT_ENABLED=true

# In-Memory Database (recommended for multi-process environments)
# When true, each process uses its own in-memory SQLite database, eliminating
# database lock contention. The index is rebuilt from markdown files on startup.
# Set to false only if you need to share database state across processes.
